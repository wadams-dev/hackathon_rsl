        <p>This program has changed my life in so many ways. Growing up with a single mom who had two jobs, there was a lot I had to learn on my own. Ready.Set.Life gave me the tools I need to be independent and successful.</p>

          <p>The Ready.Set.Life program gave my son the tools I wish I had when I was younger. As a father I struggle with finances, so the fact that my son has a good understanding of finance at such a young age makes me proud. </p>

          <p>As a guidance counselor, I see first hand the growth that the youth have from when they start to when they finish the program. It is completely transformative and every city should have a program like this!</p>
